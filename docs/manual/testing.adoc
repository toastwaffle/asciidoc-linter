== Test Strategy

=== Goals and Objectives

The testing strategy for the AsciiDoc Linter aims to:

* Ensure reliable detection of AsciiDoc formatting issues
* Prevent false positives that could frustrate users
* Maintain high code quality through comprehensive testing
* Enable safe refactoring through good test coverage
* Support rapid development through automated testing

=== Test Levels

==== Unit Tests
* Test individual rules in isolation
* Verify rule logic and error detection
* Cover edge cases and special scenarios
* Test configuration options

==== Integration Tests
* Test interaction between parser and rules
* Verify correct document processing
* Test CLI interface and options
* Test reporter output formats

==== System Tests
* End-to-end testing of the linter
* Test with real AsciiDoc documents
* Verify correct error reporting
* Test performance with large documents

=== Test Coverage Goals

[cols="2,1,2"]
|===
|Component |Target Coverage |Current Coverage

|Core (parser, linter) |90% |0%
|Rules |95% |88%
|CLI |80% |0%
|Reporter |85% |0%
|Overall |90% |61%
|===

=== Quality Metrics

* Line Coverage: Minimum 90%
* Branch Coverage: Minimum 85%
* Mutation Score: Minimum 80%
* Test Success Rate: 100%
* No known bugs in production

== Test Implementation

=== Test Patterns

==== Rule Tests

[source,python]
----
def test_rule_pattern(self):
    # Given: Setup test data and context
    content = "test content"
    rule = TestRule(config)
    
    # When: Execute the rule
    findings = rule.check(content)
    
    # Then: Verify results
    assert_findings(findings)
----

==== Integration Tests

[source,python]
----
def test_integration_pattern(self):
    # Given: Setup test environment
    doc = create_test_document()
    linter = setup_linter()
    
    # When: Process document
    results = linter.process(doc)
    
    # Then: Verify complete workflow
    verify_results(results)
----

=== Test Data Management

==== Test Documents
* Maintain a collection of test documents
* Include both valid and invalid examples
* Document the purpose of each test file
* Version control test data

==== Test Fixtures
* Use pytest fixtures for common setup
* Share test data between related tests
* Clean up test environment after each test
* Mock external dependencies

== Running Tests

=== Local Development

[source,bash]
----
# Run all tests
python run_tests.py

# Run with coverage
coverage run -m pytest
coverage report
coverage html

# Run specific test categories
pytest tests/rules/
pytest tests/integration/
pytest tests/system/
----

=== Continuous Integration

==== GitHub Actions Workflow

=== Test Templates

==== Unit Test Template

[source,python]
----
class TestRuleName(unittest.TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        """Setup test environment"""
        self.rule = RuleUnderTest()
    
    def test_valid_case(self):
        """Test with valid input"""
        # Given
        content = "valid content"
        
        # When
        findings = self.rule.check(content)
        
        # Then
        self.assertEqual(len(findings), 0)
    
    def test_invalid_case(self):
        """Test with invalid input"""
        # Given
        content = "invalid content"
        
        # When
        findings = self.rule.check(content)
        
        # Then
        self.assertEqual(len(findings), 1)
        self.assertEqual(findings[0].severity, Severity.ERROR)
