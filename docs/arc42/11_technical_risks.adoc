# 11_technical_risks.adoc - Technical Risks

== Technical Risks and Technical Debt

=== Current Issues (December 2024)

==== Test Failures
* 3 failed tests in table processing
* Issues with cell extraction and list detection
* Impact on table validation reliability

==== Coverage Gaps
* rules.py: 0% coverage
* reporter.py: 85% coverage
* block_rules.py: 89% coverage

==== Implementation Issues
* Inconsistent severity case handling
* Missing rule_id attribute in base class
* Table content validation problems

=== Mitigation Strategy

==== Phase 1: Critical Issues (1-2 weeks)
1. Fix table processing
2. Add missing tests
3. Standardize severity handling

==== Phase 2: Important Improvements (2-3 weeks)
1. Improve documentation
2. Enhance error handling
3. Add configuration options

==== Phase 3: Long-term Stability (3-4 weeks)
1. Performance optimization
2. Memory management
3. Plugin architecture improvements
