# ADR-001-rule-base-class.adoc - Rule Base Class Design Decision

== ADR 1: Rule Base Class Design

=== Status
Accepted

=== Context
We need a flexible and extensible way to implement different linting rules for AsciiDoc documents.

=== Decision
We will use an abstract base class `Rule` with a defined interface that all concrete rules must implement.

=== Consequences
* *Positive*
** Consistent interface for all rules
** Easy to add new rules
** Clear separation of concerns
** Simplified testing through common interface
* *Negative*
** Additional abstraction layer
** Slight performance overhead
