# ADR-005-table-processing-strategy.adoc - Table Processing Strategy Decision

== ADR 5: Table Processing Strategy

=== Status
Proposed

=== Context
Table processing in AsciiDoc documents requires complex parsing and validation:
* Tables can contain various content types (text, lists, blocks)
* Cell extraction needs to handle multi-line content
* Column counting must be reliable
* List detection in cells must be accurate

Current implementation has issues:
* Cell extraction produces incorrect results
* List detection generates false positives
* Column counting is unreliable

=== Decision
We will implement a new table processing strategy:

1. *Two-Pass Parsing*
   * First pass: Identify table boundaries and structure
   * Second pass: Extract and validate cell content

2. *Cell Content Model*
   * Create a dedicated TableCell class
   * Track content type (text, list, block)
   * Maintain line number information

3. *List Detection*
   * Use state machine for list recognition
   * Track list context across cell boundaries
   * Validate list markers against AsciiDoc spec

4. *Column Management*
   * Count columns based on header row
   * Validate all rows against header
   * Handle empty cells explicitly

=== Technical Details

[source,python]
----
class TableCell:
    def __init__(self):
        self.content = []
        self.content_type = None
        self.start_line = None
        self.end_line = None
        self.has_list = False
        self.list_level = 0

class TableRow:
    def __init__(self):
        self.cells = []
        self.line_number = None
        self.is_header = False

class TableProcessor:
    def first_pass(self, lines):
        # Identify table structure
        pass

    def second_pass(self, table_lines):
        # Extract cell content
        pass

    def detect_lists(self, cell):
        # Use state machine for list detection
        pass

=== Consequences

* *Positive*
** More accurate cell extraction
** Reliable list detection
** Better error reporting
** Maintainable code structure
** Clear separation of concerns

* *Negative*
** More complex implementation
** Slightly higher memory usage
** Additional processing overhead
** More code to maintain

=== Implementation Plan

1. Phase 1: Core Structure
   * Implement TableCell and TableRow classes
   * Basic two-pass parsing
   * Unit tests for basic functionality

2. Phase 2: Content Processing
   * List detection state machine
   * Content type recognition
   * Error context collection

3. Phase 3: Validation
   * Column counting
   * Structure validation
   * Comprehensive test suite

=== Validation

Success criteria:
* All current table-related tests pass
* Cell extraction matches expected results
* List detection has no false positives
* Column counting is accurate
* Memory usage remains within limits
