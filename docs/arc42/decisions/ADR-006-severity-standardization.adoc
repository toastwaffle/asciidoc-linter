# ADR-006-severity-standardization.adoc - Severity Standardization Decision

== ADR 6: Severity Standardization

=== Status
Proposed

=== Context
Current implementation has inconsistent severity level handling:
* Mixed case usage (ERROR vs error)
* Inconsistent severity levels across rules
* No clear guidelines for severity assignment

=== Decision
We will standardize severity handling:

1. *Severity Levels*
   * ERROR: Issues that must be fixed
   * WARNING: Issues that should be reviewed
   * INFO: Suggestions for improvement

2. *Implementation*
   * Use lowercase for internal representation
   * Provide case-sensitive display methods
   * Add severity level documentation

3. *Migration*
   * Update all existing rules
   * Add validation in base class
   * Update tests to use new standard

=== Consequences
* *Positive*
** Consistent severity handling
** Clear guidelines for new rules
** Better user experience
* *Negative*
** Need to update existing code
** Potential backward compatibility issues
