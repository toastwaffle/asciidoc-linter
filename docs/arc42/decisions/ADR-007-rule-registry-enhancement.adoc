# ADR-007-rule-registry-enhancement.adoc - Rule Registry Enhancement Decision

== ADR 7: Rule Registry Enhancement

=== Status
Proposed

=== Context
Current rule registry implementation lacks:
* Test coverage
* Clear registration mechanism
* Version handling
* Rule dependency management

=== Decision
We will enhance the rule registry:

1. *Registration*
   * Add explicit registration decorator
   * Support rule dependencies
   * Add version information

2. *Management*
   * Add rule enabling/disabling
   * Support rule groups
   * Add configuration validation

3. *Testing*
   * Add comprehensive test suite
   * Test all registration scenarios
   * Test configuration handling

=== Consequences
* *Positive*
** Better rule management
** Clear registration process
** Improved testability
* *Negative*
** More complex implementation
** Additional maintenance overhead
